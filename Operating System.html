        An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources and provides common services for computer programs.For hardware functions such as input and output 
         and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is 
          usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. <br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Vishnu Priya

      <p><b>Expectation</b><br><br>Learning OS changes the perception of a coder to a large extent. A good OS concept will increase my value as a coder also. </p>
