        <h2> Computer Architecture</h2>
       <p>Computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Architecture is decribed as the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.It
            involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Anoop Tiwari
        </p>
        <p><b>Expectation</b><br><br>The subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and how it works will help me design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to
            use because i will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>
