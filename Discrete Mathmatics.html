        Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. 
        In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as
        integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics
        therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Manoj

             <p><b>Expectation</b><br><br>The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers,
                 i need a solid background in this subjects.</p>
